Hi, I'm Matthew Aldridge. I'm a lecturer at the [University of Leeds](https://www.leeds.ac.uk) in the [School of Mathematics](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths), in the [Statistics department](https://eps.leeds.ac.uk/maths-statistics).

I study probability, information theory, combinatorics, statistics and related things. I’m particularly interested in group testing, a problem that models testing a large population for a blood disease that also has applications in communications, computer science, genetics and has been used during the Covid pandemic. I’m also interested in ways of coping with interference in large multiuser communications networks.
